# Random GitHub Issue

Basically a powershell core script that will choose some random github issues
for you to work on.

Having said this they are not totally random. You can configure the scope
of repositories you want to cover. Probably you wont to work on your own
repositories, and maybe you want to work on some of other people. 

You can set these as preferences so its not totally random.
But random enough if you like me some day sit at your computer and ask yourself:
Hey, what to do with that nice rainy afternoon.
